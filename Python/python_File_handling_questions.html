            { id: 1, question: "What is the difference between a text file and a binary file?", solution: "A text file is a file that stores information in the form of a stream of ASCII or Unicode characters. In text files, each line of text is terminated with a special character (as per the Operating System) known as EOL (End of Line) character.\n\nA binary file is a file that stores the information in the form of a stream of bytes. In a binary file, there is no delimiter for a line and no character translations occur here." },
            { id: 2, question: "What is the difference between read() and readlines() function?", solution: "The read() function reads from a file in read mode, and stores its entire contents in a single string type variable.\n\nThe readlines() function reads from a file in read mode and returns a list of all lines in the file." },
            { id: 3, question: "Differentiate between the following:\n(i) f = open('diary.txt', 'r')\n(ii) f = open('diary.txt', 'w')", solution: "(i) The text file diary.txt has been opened in read mode with file handle f. This means the program can only read from the file. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError will be raised.\n\n(ii) The text file diary.txt has been opened in write mode with file handle f. This means the program can write to the file. If the file exists, its contents will be truncated (overwritten). If the file does not exist, a new empty file will be created." },
            { id: 4, question: "What is the difference between readline() and readlines() function?", solution: "The readline() function reads from a file in read mode and returns the next line in the file or a blank string ('') if there are no more lines. The returned data is of string type.\n\nThe readlines() function, also reads from a file in read mode and returns a list of all lines in the file. The returned data is of list type." },
            { id: 5, question: "What is the difference between write() and writelines() functions?", solution: "Both write() and writelines() functions are used to write data to text files.\n\nThe write() function takes an argument of string type and writes it to the file. It does not automatically add a newline character (\\n) after the string.\n\nThe writelines() function, on the other hand, takes an iterable (such as a list or tuple of strings, or even a string itself) as an argument and writes all its elements to the file. Like write(), it does not automatically add newline characters; each string in the iterable should typically include \\n if separate lines are desired." },
            { id: 6, question: "Write a single loop to display all the contents of a text file poem.txt after removing leading and trailing whitespaces.", solution: "```python\n# Assume poem.txt exists with some content\n# For example:\n#   \"  This is a line.  \\n\"\n#   \"Another line. \\n\"\n#   \"  Last one.  \"\nfor line in open(\"poem.txt\"):\n    print(line.strip())\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe open(\"poem.txt\") directly returns an iterable file object. The for loop iterates through each line of the file. For each line, line.strip() removes any leading and trailing whitespace characters (including newlines) before print() displays it." },
            { id: 7, question: "Write a function stats() that accepts a filename and reports the file's longest line.", solution: "```python\ndef stats(filename):\n    longest = \"\" # Initialize with an empty string\n    \n    # Open the file for reading\n    # Using 'with' statement is generally preferred for file handling\n    with open(filename, \"r\") as file_handle:\n        for line in file_handle: # Iterate through each line in the file\n            if len(line) > len(longest): # Compare current line's length with longest found so far\n                longest = line # Update longest if current line is longer\n    \n    print(\"Longest line's length =\", len(longest))\n    print(longest)\n\n# Example usage (assuming 'poem.txt' exists with some lines)\n# stats(\"poem.txt\")\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe function initializes longest as an empty string. It then iterates through each line in the specified filename. In each iteration, it compares the len() of the current line with the len() of longest. If the current line is longer, it updates longest to that line. Finally, it prints the length and content of the longest line found." },
            { id: 8, question: "What is the output of following code fragment? Explain.\nout = open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") # Changed file() to open() for modern Python\nout.write(\"Hello, world!\\n\")\nout.write(\"How are you?\")\nout.close()\nopen(\"output.txt\").read() # Changed file() to open()", solution: "The output will be:\n'Hello, world!\\nHow are you?'\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. out = open(\"output.txt\", \"w\"): This line opens a file named output.txt in write mode (\"w\"). If the file exists, it truncates its contents. If not, it creates a new file.\n2. out.write(\"Hello, world!\\n\"): This writes the string \"Hello, world!\" followed by a newline character to output.txt.\n3. out.write(\"How are you?\"): This writes the string \"How are you?\" immediately after the previous content (on the next line due to \\n).\n4. out.close(): This line closes the file, ensuring that all buffered data is written to disk.\n5. open(\"output.txt\").read(): This line re-opens output.txt (by default in read mode r) and then reads its entire content using read(). The read() function returns the entire file content as a single string.\nTherefore, the output is the combined string content of the file." },
            { id: 9, question: "Write a function remove_lowercase() that accepts two filenames, and copies all lines that do not start with a lowercase letter from the first file into the second.", solution: "```python\ndef remove_lowercase(infile, outfile):\n    # Open the output file in write mode\n    with open(outfile, \"w\") as output_file:\n        # Open the input file in read mode\n        with open(infile, \"r\") as input_file:\n            for line in input_file: # Iterate through each line in the input file\n                # Check if the line is not empty and its first character is not a lowercase letter\n                if line and not ('a' <= line[0] <= 'z'):\n                    output_file.write(line) # Write the line to the output file\n\n# Example usage:\n# Create a dummy input file for testing\n# with open(\"input.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n#     f.write(\"Hello World\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"apple pie\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"123 Numbers\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"Zebra\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"another line\\n\")\n# remove_lowercase(\"input.txt\", \"output_filtered.txt\")\n\n# To verify the output_filtered.txt:\n# with open(\"output_filtered.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n#     print(f.read())\n# Expected output_filtered.txt:\n# Hello World\n# 123 Numbers\n# Zebra\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe function opens both input and output files. It iterates through each line of the infile. For each line, it checks if the line is not empty and if its first character (line[0]) is NOT within the range of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). If the condition is true, the line is written to the outfile." },
            { id: 10, question: "What is the output of following code?\nopen(\"e:\\\\poem.txt\", \"r\").readline().split()\nRecall that poem.txt has some leading and trailing whitespaces.", solution: "Assuming poem.txt contains a line like: \" WHY?\\n\"\nThe output will be:\n['WHY?']\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. open(\"e:\\\\poem.txt\", \"r\"): Opens the file poem.txt in read mode.\n2. .readline(): Reads the first line from the file, including the newline character. So, it reads \" WHY?\\n\".\n3. .split(): When split() is called without any arguments, it splits the string by any whitespace and removes empty strings from the result. It also handles leading/trailing whitespace. Thus, \" WHY?\\n\".split() results in ['WHY?']." },
            { id: 11, question: "What is the output of following code?\nopen(\"e:\\\\poem.txt\", \"r\").readline()", solution: "Assuming poem.txt contains a line like: \"WHY?\\n\"\nThe output will be:\n'WHY?\\n'\n\n**Explanation:**\nopen(\"e:\\\\poem.txt\", \"r\").readline() reads the first line from the file, including the newline character (\\n), and returns it as a string." },
            { id: 12, question: "What is the output of following code?\nfh = open(\"poem.txt\",\"r\")\nsize = len(fh.read())\nprint(fh.read(5))", solution: "No output (or blank output).\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. fh = open(\"poem.txt\",\"r\"): Opens poem.txt in read mode. The file pointer is at the beginning (position 0).\n2. size = len(fh.read()): fh.read() without an argument reads the entire content of the file from the current file pointer position. After this operation, the file pointer is moved to the end of the file (EOF). The len() calculates the length of the entire content, but this value is assigned to size and not printed.\n3. print(fh.read(5)): Now, fh.read(5) attempts to read 5 bytes from the current file pointer position. Since the file pointer is already at the EOF (due to the previous fh.read() call), there are no more bytes to be read. Therefore, fh.read(5) returns an empty string (''), and print() displays nothing." },

It uses a while True loop to continuously read lines using readline(). An empty string returned by readline() indicates the end of the file, at which point the loop breaks. For each valid line, a counter is incremented, and the counter along with the line content is printed. end='' is used in print() because readline() includes the newline character from the file, and print() adds its own newline by default, which would result in double spacing." },

            { id: 25, question: "Write a program that copies a text file \"source.txt\" onto \"target.txt\" barring the lines starting with a \"@\" sign.", solution: "```python\ndef filter(oldfile, newfile):\n    fin = open(oldfile, \"r\") # Open source file for reading\n    fout = open(newfile, \"w\") # Open target file for writing (will create/overwrite)\n    while True:\n        text = fin.readline() # Read one line at a time\n        if len(text) == 0: # Check for End Of File (EOF)\n            break\n        if text[0] == '@': # Check if the line starts with '@'\n            continue # If it does, skip to the next iteration (don't write this line)\n        fout.write(text) # If not starting with '@', write the line to the output file\n    fin.close()\n    fout.close()\n\n# Example usage:\n# Create a dummy source.txt\n# with open(\"source.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n#     f.write(\"Line 1\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"@This line should be skipped\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"Line 3\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"@Another skipped line\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"Line 5\\n\")\n#     f.write(\"Final line.\\n\")\n# filter(\"source.txt\", \"target.txt\")\n\n# To verify target.txt:\n# with open(\"target.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n#     print(f.read())\n# Expected target.txt:\n# Line 1\n# Line 3\n# Line 5\n# Final line.\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe filter function takes two filenames. It opens the oldfile for reading and newfile for writing. It reads lines one by one using readline(). If readline() returns an empty string, it signifies EOF, and the loop breaks. It checks if the first character of the text is '@'. If it is, continue skips the rest of the current loop iteration, effectively not writing that line. Otherwise, the line is written to fout. Finally, both files are closed." },
            { id: 26, question: "Consider the following statement. In which file mode is the file opened? Justify your answer.\nwith open('poem.txt') as f:", solution: "The file is opened in read mode ('r').\n\n**Justification:**\nWhen the mode argument is not explicitly specified in the open() function, Python defaults to the read mode ('r'). This means the file is opened for reading existing content. If the file poem.txt does not exist, a FileNotFoundError would be raised." },
            { id: 27, question: "What is pickling process? What is its need?", solution: "The pickling process (also known as serialization) is the method of converting a Python object hierarchy (which can be a single object or a complex structure like a nested list, dictionary, or custom class instance) into a byte stream. This byte stream is a flattened, machine-readable representation of the object.\n\n**Need for Pickling:**\nObjects in Python often have a specific structure, data types, and interrelationships (hierarchy). When storing these complex objects to a file, especially in binary files, it is crucial that their original structure and data integrity are maintained so that they can be perfectly reconstructed later. Pickling addresses this need by:\n- Preserving Object Structure: It ensures that the exact state and relationships of complex Python objects are saved, unlike simple text-based storage which might lose type information or nested structures.\n- Enabling Persistent Storage: It allows Python objects to be stored permanently in binary files on disk, so they can be retrieved and used in future program executions.\n- Facilitating Data Exchange: It enables the transfer of Python objects between different Python programs or even across a network.\nPython provides the pickle module specifically to handle this serialization and deserialization, ensuring that objects are converted into a byte stream that can be reliably de-serialized back into their original form." },
            { id: 28, question: "What is unpickling?", solution: "Unpickling is the inverse operation of pickling (also known as deserialization). It is the process whereby a byte stream (which was previously created by pickling a Python object and is typically read from a binary file) is converted back into its original Python object hierarchy in memory. This process produces an exact replica of the object that was originally pickled, including its data, type, and internal structure." },
            { id: 29, question: "What is the difference between a regular text file and a delimited text file?", solution: "Regular Text Files are files that store textual information in the same form as it is typed, using standard character encodings like ASCII or Unicode. Each line in a regular text file is typically terminated by a platform-specific newline character (EOL). These files often have extensions like .txt and are easily readable and editable with any basic text editor. Text translations (like EOL conversion) occur when reading/writing these files across different operating systems.\n\nDelimited Text Files are a specific type of text file where a particular character (the delimiter) is used to separate individual data values (fields) within each record (line). This format is primarily used for storing tabular data. Common delimiters include commas (for CSV files), tabs (for TSV files), semicolons, or pipes. While they are still human-readable (though less so than regular text files without a proper viewer), their primary purpose is to organize data into a structured, tabular format for easier parsing by programs. Text translations still occur, but the csv module in Python helps manage the delimiters effectively." },
            { id: 30, question: "What are CSV files?", solution: "CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are a type of delimited text file where values within each data record (line) are primarily separated by a comma (,). Each line in a CSV file typically represents a single data record, and the values within that record correspond to different fields or columns. While the comma is the default and most common delimiter, CSV files can also use other characters as delimiters (e.g., tab, semicolon, pipe), though this is less common. CSV files typically have the .csv extension. They are widely used for exchanging tabular data between different applications, such as spreadsheets and databases, due to their simple and universal structure." },
            { id: 31, question: "What is the significance of newline='' argument in file open() function?", solution: "The newline='' argument in the open() function is crucial for ensuring that no End-of-Line (EOL) translation takes place when reading from or writing to text files (including CSV files).\n\n**Significance:**\n- Prevents Extra Blank Lines: When writing to a text file without newline='', Python's open() function (in text mode) might add an additional newline character (\\n) on top of the newline character already added by the csv.writer (or if you explicitly include \\n in your write() calls). This results in double newlines, which appear as blank lines when the file is read. newline='' suppresses this automatic addition.\n- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Different operating systems use different EOL sequences (\\n for Unix, \\r\\n for Windows, \\r for old Mac). If a file is written on one OS and read on another without newline='', the EOL characters might be misinterpreted, leading to issues like extra blank lines or incorrect parsing. newline='' ensures that the file is treated as raw lines without any platform-specific EOL conversions, making it truly portable.\n- Correct CSV Parsing: For CSV files, the csv module expects to handle newlines itself. By setting newline='', you prevent Python's default text mode from interfering with the csv module's newline handling, thus avoiding blank rows and ensuring accurate parsing of records." },
            { id: 32, question: "What does csv.writer object do?", solution: "The csv.writer object is a key component of Python's csv module used for writing data to CSV files. Its primary function is to add delimitation to the user data (which is typically provided as a Python sequence like a list or tuple) before storing that data in the CSV file on the storage disk.\n\nIn essence, it takes a Python sequence (e.g., ['School', 'Nickname', 'Sport']), converts it into a single delimited string (e.g., \"School,Nickname,Sport\" if the delimiter is a comma), and then writes this formatted string as a record (line) to the associated CSV file. It handles quoting rules and escaping special characters automatically, ensuring the data is correctly formatted for CSV standards." },
            { id: 33, question: "What is the function of csv.reader object?", solution: "The csv.reader object, provided by Python's csv module, is used for reading data from CSV files. Its main function is to read data from a CSV file on the storage disk, parse it (i.e., remove the delimitation), and load the parsed data into a Python iterator.\n\nFrom this iterator, you can then fetch the data row by row, typically using a for loop. Each row fetched by the csv.reader object is returned as a list of strings, where each string represents a field from that row, with the delimiters automatically removed and quoting rules handled." },

This position marks the beginning of the record that is about to be read. Storing this position (position) is crucial because pickle.load() advances the file pointer past the read record.\n- Line 2 (fin.seek(position)): After modifying the record in memory, fin.seek(position) is used to move the file pointer back to the exact beginning of that record. This ensures that the subsequent pickle.dump(stu, fin) operation overwrites the original record's data in the file rather than writing it at a new location or corrupting subsequent records." },

If `line` (the nested list `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`) is iterated, `line_item` would be `[1,2,3]` then `[4,5,6]`, which is correct for `writerow`.\nHowever, the original solution in the document pointed to an error with `writerow` vs `writerows` if the intent was to write the *entire* nested list `line` at once.\n\n**If the intent is to write the nested list `line` (from line 2) as multiple rows using a loop (as the code suggests):**\nThe code snippet `for line_item in data:` assumes `data` is the nested list.

Also display number of students scoring above 75%.", solution: "```python\nimport pickle\ndef CountRec():\n    fobj = open(\"STUDENT.DAT\", \"rb\") # Open binary file in read binary mode\n    num = 0 # Initialize counter for students above 75%\n    try:\n        while True: # Loop indefinitely until EOFError\n            rec = pickle.load(fobj) # Read a student record (tuple)\n            # Assuming record is a tuple like (admission_number, Name, Percentage)\n            if rec[2] > 75: # Check if Percentage (at index 2) is above 75\n                print(rec[0], rec[1], rec[2], sep=\"\\t\") # Print details separated by tab\n                num = num + 1 # Increment count\n    except EOFError:\n        fobj.close() # Close file when EOF is reached\n        return num # Return the total count\n\n# Example usage:\n# First, create a dummy STUDENT.DAT for testing\n# dummy_students = [\n#     (101, 'Alice', 80.5),\n#     (102, 'Bob', 72.0),\n#     (103, 'Charlie', 90.0),\n#     (104, 'David', 75.0),\n#     (105, 'Eve', 88.0)\n# ]\n# with open(\"STUDENT.DAT\", \"wb\") as f:\n#     for student_rec in dummy_students:\n#         pickle.dump(student_rec, f)\n# students_above_75 = CountRec()\n# print(f\"Number of students scoring above 75%: {students_above_75}\")\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe CountRec() function opens STUDENT.DAT in read binary mode. It initializes num to 0. It reads records (assumed to be tuples) one by one using pickle.load() within a try...except EOFError block. It checks if the percentage (the third element, rec[2]) is greater than 75. If true, it prints the student's details separated by tabs and increments num. Once EOFError is caught, the file is closed, and the total num is returned." },
            { id: 49, question: "Write a function Show_words() in python to read the content of a text file 'NOTES.TXT' and display the entire content in capital letters.\nExample, if the file contains:\nThis is a test file\nThen the function should display the output as:\nTHIS IS A TEST FILE", solution: "```python\ndef Show_words():\n    file_handle = open('NOTES.TXT', 'r') # Renamed variable\n    Lines = file_handle.readlines() # Read all lines into a list\n    for L in Lines: # Iterate through each line in the list\n        print(L.upper(), end='') # Convert line to uppercase and print. Use end='' to avoid double newlines.\n    file_handle.close()\n\n# Example usage (assuming NOTES.TXT exists)\n# Show_words()\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe Show_words() function opens NOTES.TXT in read mode. It reads all lines into a list called Lines. It then iterates through each L (line) in Lines. For each line, L.upper() converts the entire line to uppercase, and print(..., end='') displays it. end='' is used because each line read by readlines() already includes its newline character, and print() would add another by default. The file is closed after processing." },
            { id: 50, question: "Write a program to increase the salary by Rs. 2000/- of the employee having empno as 1251 in the file empl.dat.", solution: "```python\nimport pickle\nemp = {} # Initialize an empty dictionary to hold read records\nfound = False # Flag to track if the target employee was found and updated\n# Open binary file 'empl.dat' in read and write binary mode ('rb+')\nfin = open('empl.dat', 'rb+')\nfin.seek(0) # Ensure file pointer is at the beginning of the file\nprint(\"Updating employee salary in empl.dat...\")\ntry:\n    while True:\n        rpos = fin.tell() # Store current file-pointer position before reading\n        emp = pickle.load(fin) # Read an employee record (dictionary)\n        if emp['Empno'] == 1251: # Check if this is the target employee\n            emp['Salary'] = emp['Salary'] + 2000 # Increase salary in memory\n            fin.seek(rpos) # Move file-pointer back to the start of this record\n            pickle.dump(emp, fin) # Overwrite the old record with the updated one\n            print(f\"Updated record: {emp}\") # Print the updated record\n            found = True\nexcept EOFError:\n    if not found:\n        print(\"Sorry, no matching employee with Empno 1251 found.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Employee record(s) successfully updated.\")\n    fin.close() # Close the file\n\n# Example usage:\n# First, create a dummy empl.dat for testing\n# dummy_employees = [\n#     {'Empno': 1201, 'Name': 'Anushree', 'Salary': 47000},\n#     {'Empno': 1251, 'Name': 'Simarjeet', 'Salary': 49000}, # This one will be updated\n#     {'Empno': 1266, 'Name': 'Alex', 'Salary': 50000}\n# ]\n# with open(\"empl.dat\", \"wb\") as f:\n#     for employee_rec in dummy_employees:\n#         pickle.dump(employee_rec, f)\n# # Run the update program\n# # (After running, you can read empl.dat to verify the change)\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe program opens empl.dat in rb+ mode (read and write binary). It uses fin.seek(0) to ensure the file pointer starts at the beginning. It then loops, reading each employee record (dictionary) using pickle.load(). Before each read, fin.tell() saves the current position (rpos). If the Empno matches 1251, the Salary is updated in the emp dictionary. Then, fin.seek(rpos) moves the file pointer back to the start of that record, and pickle.dump(emp, fin) overwrites the old record with the modified one. The EOFError is handled to close the file and report success or failure." },

It converts the content to lowercase and splits it into a wordlist. It then uses a dictionary `wordfreq` to store the frequency of each word. It iterates through the wordlist, updating the counts in the dictionary. After counting, it iterates through the dictionary to find the word with the highest frequency. Finally, it prints the most common word and its count, followed by a list of all words and their frequencies, sorted alphabetically.\nThis approach using a dictionary is more efficient for counting word frequencies than using `list.count()` repeatedly in a loop, especially for larger files." },
